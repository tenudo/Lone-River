Thank you for your willingness to fill in on such short notice! As you know, this project is part of a larger survey of wolves along the Minnesota-Ontario border. You will be in charge of observing and documenting the Lone River pack.<br><br>
Since the previous Lone River team backed out of the project so suddenly, you will be on your own for the foreseeable future. I know you’re more than capable, but do not hesitate to reach out if you need assistance with anything. I can send someone from another team your way.
<br><br>
In the last several years of documentation, we have seen this to be an average sized pack (~4-8 wolves) with a rather small territory. Much remains to be understood about their behavior. Of particular interest in the Lone River pack is the dispersal wolf that joined April of last year, since it’s a bit atypical to see an adult wolf join a pack whose breeding pair is still active. You will find complete notes from the previous team in the cabin.
<br><br>
If you need anything, you know how to reach me. Glad to work with you again.
<br><br>
Best of luck,<br>
Dr. Jennifer Everett

        The cabin is well-stocked, and everything appears to be in working order, except a couple of outlets. Food supplies in particular will last well into the winter, which means I should be able to stay here for quite some time; the nearest town is about 100 miles away. I found a small stack of extra blankets by the fireplace, downy to the touch. It’s not too cold yet, but these will be well appreciated when the temperature drops.    </div>

        There are gardening tools resting against the cabin. They seem to be in fairly good condition, although I’m not sure I’ll need them for anything.

        You were never very handy, but you’d always try your level best, and sometimes for hours, before asking anyone for help. Like that time I came to help you fix your car when the starter was out, and your hands were already caked in motor grease when I arrived. I admired that about you, that tenacity, but I worried you would never tell me when something was wrong.
        <br><br>
        I couldn’t find any signs of gardening around, so perhaps they were set outside because they weren’t needed. I’m bringing them back in to keep them safe.

        Caught a glimpse of a couple wolves off by the river. They seemed to be following it eastward, which I believe leads to the lake, although I haven’t been out that way quite yet. I can’t yet tell them apart from a distance. They seemed large; possibly the parent pair.

        One dark and lone crow perched right on the cabin roof this morning. They ought to be fairly common in this area, rich as it is in wildlife, but this is the first I’ve seen.

        The larger stones lying in the center of the river create a convenient path across, not that it’s especially deep at this point. When I see something like this, I wonder whether it’s constructed, or whether they’ve fallen in such a way in some convenient cosmic circumstance. Or perhaps there really is an intentionality to nature, as some are inclined to say; some kind of underlying order that we can’t quite grasp. I wonder as much when I look at the wolves. How they’ve come to be just so from what they once were, little amorphous cells in a vast ocean of time.

        There was a pair of deer out by the river today, presumably a mother and her adult child. They often stick together for a couple years before departing, not unlike wolves.

        I spotted wolf LR54 today - that’s Cedar. His coat is a lovely golden-brown shade, patterned with dark, rich hazel stripes. 
        Lying as he is in that low rectangle of sun with his front half emblazoned gold and his back half in shadow, he reminds me of that Shinx you caught on my cartridge of <i>Pokemon Platinum.</i> I watched you run back and forth through the bright pixel grass, leaning up into the faded edge of my college dorm’s green sofa. You can see it in that photo my sister took of us, the positions in which we were accustomed to lounging, habitually, just far enough apart. 
        <br>“I think you’re doing it wrong, Vik,” I said, and you laughed and elbowed me gently.

        According to the info sheets, this hollow is where the wolves had their den last April. They will have abandoned it now, and I haven’t seen a wolf actually go inside. However, the juveniles seem rather accustomed to roaming this area in the absence of their parents. Call of the familiar, I imagine. Home as a source of comfort, of safety. I wonder how that feels.

        I’ve gotten well enough at noting them from a distance to recognize these two as the breeding pair. It helps that they are wont to stick together, especially when out hunting. Bracken has striking patches of white in his coat, more than any of their offspring, who all seem to take after their mother. Her coat isn’t fully black and brown but it’s quite a bit darker than his, and the white is comparatively sparse. Apparently Thatch was an uncollared dispersal wolf, because they gave her a Lone River ID. She joined the pack two years back after the death of the previous female.
        <br><br>I wonder what it would be like to live such a short life. There are probably no wolves alive who were born before I first met you.

        I think I saw a dispersal wolf. There’s no mention of one anywhere in the notes, so it must be new to the area. I believe it had a fully black coat, which is quite rare, but not unheard of, in Minnesota. I’m not sure, though. From so far away, I suppose it could have been Thatch in deep shadow.

It’s not baby’s breath, but it reminds me of that bouquet you gave me once; little stardust bursts of white clustered among the clover. And roses, of course, and lilies. I remember how they looked, pale and gleaming, lying in spades of glass against the cool blue-patterned tile. <i>What a shame,</i> I thought, but I should have known better.

        It’s been rainy for the past couple of days, so every once in a while I’ll see tracks pressed into the forest floor. This trail is especially clear, heading off north toward their preferred hunting grounds. It was definitely one of the adults, as the juveniles are still noticeably smaller, but I can’t say which. One of these days I ought to grab a camera and follow them, but the foliage out there is very dense.

        I cleaned my boots this afternoon, and when I laid them near the door to dry I suddenly felt so sick to my stomach to look at them. We picked these out together a few years back, you and I, trying to find a pair that didn’t resemble the ones my dad always wore. We wandered the shoe store for a long time; my nervousness was setting us both on edge. Even in his absence he had the ability to keep us agitated. Afraid. They’re as different as they can be, I guess, but to a certain extent, all boots look the same.

        I’ve been going through the photos from the other team, and in these winter landscapes I’m noticing how much Flax and Watercress gravitate toward one another. I didn’t see them much in August, but they’ve been around a lot more lately. As Jen wrote, it is strange for Flax to have joined and stuck around given Bracken’s still well and around. Maybe he knows he’s older, but I don’t know. Something about this picture, the way they’re leaning into each other… it makes my heart ache.

        Kate took this photo of us back in college, the year we graduated. You and I in my small dormitory living room, where we hung out together between classes - much closer to campus than where you were living with your parents. I think you were laughing at something she said. I wasn’t paying attention - in the photo you can see me staring at you. 
<br><br>
        For those first few weeks there was some great novelty to me in being able to just look. To look at you, to really see you, without guilt or fear or shame. Even through the glossy emulsion I can see this kind of captivating radiance about you. It’s always been there, for as long as I’ve known you; even as a teenager, you were so, I don’t know, self-possessed. You gave me those flowers a week before you told me you were gay. Until then, I don’t think I’d ever thought about myself at all.

        We were only living together for a few months, but we’ve always been creatures of habit, and we fell so quickly into routine. I made the coffee in the morning, every morning, because I had to get up earlier, but mostly because I liked the sleepy smile you gave me when I brought it to you in bed. When I caught a cold you took over for those few mornings, and I still think about that. Certainly it shouldn’t have startled me, this kindness of yours, but then I’ve always been so accustomed to looking out for myself, alone.

There’s a space heater, at least, but I don’t want to wear it down. I’ll need it well and working when the snow comes.

        The paired squirrels scamper over the tree branches in a last hustle for forage, busying themselves in winter preparations. Always on the move, these two, much like the ones that used to leap tree to tree in the parks we would go to to escape. In fact, I remember just such a pair dancing over the branches that time after we’d graduated high school, when atop the haphazard wooden benches we planned where we would go to college together. Perhaps it did to you, but really it never occurred to me, to go our separate ways.

        There’s a pair of wood ducks out on the river, bobbing along in the steady current. There were many of these in the park as well. A mother and her ducklings came up to us once, right up to the edge of the pier, babbling and flipping their little tails. You ran up to the wooden fence and leaned over as far as you could, looking as if you’d leap into the water after them. I followed at a leisurely pace, and though I stopped to look at the ducks, for a moment I watched you watching them instead. The autumn weather had dusted your cheeks and nose with soft color, much like the tongues of the wolves when they loll back their heads and yawn.

        I’d guess that one of the wolves broke this stick, but it could have simply fallen and dashed onto a rock.

        I’m definitely seeing an unfamiliar dispersal wolf, coat black as night all the way through. I’ve only seen it at a distance, really, but this is unmistakable.

        It was unusually hot this afternoon. The pack was gathered in the woods in full, all lazing in the shade. They make a pretty picture, all of them together, carefree and quiet. I thought of my parents and my sister, the way we looked around the dinner table; partitioned by our own habits, we were seated as far as possible apart. Kate and I would end up growing closer, but not until I moved out did we ever really talk about anything worthwhile. Mom and I had a mutual and quiet understanding, or so I felt, and in each other’s presence we’d mostly do our own things, read our own books - the comfort of presence freed from the effort of communication. And as for dad - the less said, the better.

        Predation of fish is quite exciting behavior! It’s not unknown, but it’s very uncommon in the fall months, when deer are plentiful.

A huge, gleaming salmon - how those scales glisten in the sunlight!

        I’ve been keeping an eye on these two. Something about them draws me in. Flax is the dispersal wolf, and strikingly different from the others; his coat is all white and gray, a lovely contrast against Cress’s black and brown and gold. Yesterday, I want to say, or the day before, I watched Flax strut right past the other wolves to flop down next to Cress and press his cheek up over the jut of his shoulderblade and rest his chin upon his back, and suddenly I was terrified for him.
<br><br>
        But today they’ve done it again, dozing in a low patch of sunlight among the others. I watched them and I thought, there are no rules to it, you know? The other wolves, they don’t care at all. They don’t even notice.

        Mulberry was hanging out by Flax and Cress. She’s a bit smaller than the other juveniles still, but not outside of the expected range. Despite her namesake, her coat is largely brown, with spatterings of black on her muzzle and back. She’s not purple, of course.

        Not like the cool glow of the dance hall which floated lazily up your blazer and clean cut slacks, back in our senior year of high school. We had both gone stag, and seated at a low table we watched our friends twirl in glimmering pairs, heels and dress shoes clicking on the polished floor.

        Remember that? I asked you that, once. We were out among the shops, wide streets slick with tarry asphalt, sunlight-patterned green awnings; my hands were trembling in my pockets.
        <br><br> 
        “Not really,” you said, clinging to my arm as lovers do. In that moment, your warmth emboldened me. But a year later, when we moved in together, you told the landlord we were friends.

        I heard a wolf cry outside, and in my startled leap I spilled the coffee over the edge of the table. I watched it pool on the floor for a moment, and I was struck by the sudden thought that it, seeping into those floorboards, would be alchemically changed somehow. Altered into blood, or mercury, or starlight. But the stain is still there, and it’s just coffee. Just coffee.

        <br><br>Finally, it bowed its head and turned away, trudging doggedly through the underbrush. At the river it stopped a moment and stood in silence, and I had the strangest feeling the wolf was weeping…

My dad left me a voicemail, the week before I left. I’m not sure who told him. He threatened to hurt me, to hurt you. So maybe it was because of him. But this is what I mean, Viktor; he isn’t the only one. There are so many people who hate us.

            I watched them so often these last few months. I watched them over and over, soft-footed and bushy-tailed, draw together and apart, and back together. Never so far apart that they couldn’t - that they couldn’t find each other. That they couldn’t wrestle or chase or hunt or nap, stumbling or leaping, frightened or furious, reckless, joyous in play, slow-beating hearts intertwined. 
<br><br>I watched them and I thought, only for a moment, I thought - are we really rabbits? Or are we wolves, too? I watched them for a moment and the world drew still around me, and Flax trotted over to Cress and threw the weight of his body into his shoulder, and there on the forest floor they lounged in the sunlight, among the blossoms like dusty little stars.
